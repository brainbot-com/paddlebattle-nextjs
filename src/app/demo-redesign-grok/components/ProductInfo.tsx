              Revoke.cash isn‚Äôt just a reactive tool ‚Äî use it proactively.
              Develop good wallet hygiene by periodically sweeping approvals,
              especially after using marketplaces or swapping tokens. Doing so
              reduces risk from phishing schemes and exploits. And if you ever
              fall victim to a scam, revoke the suspect approvals immediately to
              stop further losses.

              For enhanced security, install the Revoke.cash browser extension.
              It warns you in real time if you‚Äôre about to sign a token
              approval‚Äîhighlighting exactly what you‚Äôre permitting and flagging
              suspicious behavior. Official marketplaces like OpenSea, Uniswap,
              and Blur are allowlisted, so your normal transactions won‚Äôt be
              interrupted. But when danger lurks, the extension brings it to
              your attention before you sign.
